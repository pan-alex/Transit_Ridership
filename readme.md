# Transit Ridership

Exploratory data analysis of trends in ridership over time for several transit systems:

* Edmonton Transit System (ETS)

* Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)

* Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)

There is nothing mind blowing in the analysis. It provides an example of a workflow for data exploration through plotting and code examples for fun plots.



## Repository Outline:

* The analyses themselves can be viewed as `Transit_Ridership.html` or `Transit_Ridership.pdf`. The file is meant to be viewed as an html, but I have also produced a pdf that can be rendered on github.

* Original code for the analyses can be found in `Transit_Ridership.Rmd`

* Code for the animations in this readme can be found in `edmonton_ridership_animations.R`
